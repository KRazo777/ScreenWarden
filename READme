# ScreenWarden
> A Chrome/Edge extension that helps stop doomscrolling by inserting a **mindful pause** before opening distracting sites.

## ✨ Features

- ⏳ **Pause-before-open**: Shows a configurable countdown screen instead of immediately loading target sites.
  
- 🔗 **Works on typed URLs and links**: Catches direct navigation *and* clicked results.

- ✅ **Continue or Cancel**: Proceed after the countdown or back out.
  
- ⚙️ **Options page**: Edit the delay (seconds) and the list of blocked domains.
  
- 🔒 **Local & private**: No analytics, no external calls, everything stays on your machine.
